Pressure is a JavaScript library that makes dealing with Apple's Force Touch and 3D Touch simple. Force Touch for new Macs and 3D Touch for the new iPhone 6s and 6s Plus, all bundled under one roof with a simple API that makes working with them painless.

Pressure gives you a handle on browsers that do and don't support Force or 3D touch so you can plan for the users experince if they don't support it.
